# 👋 Hi, I'm AshPapi

I am a versatile developer who enjoys trying new things and learning from every project.  
On this GitHub, I keep my experiments, learning projects, and small achievements, a place where you can see how I have grown and what I have learned.  

Sometimes it is a Minecraft mod in Java, sometimes a Python clicker, sometimes an experiment with neural networks in C++, the main thing is that each project teaches me something new.

## 🛠️ What I study and work on

### 💻 C++
Worked on algorithms and data structures  
Built simple neural networks that learn from mistakes  
Practiced software engineering using **UML** and Visual Studio to plan and design systems  

### 🧠 Python
Learning exercises to get familiar with the language  
Simple clicker game  
Web project using **Django**

### 🎮 Java

### 🌐 Web

### 🐧 Systems and Databases

## 🎯 Why this GitHub exists

To keep track of my personal growth  
To make useful projects accessible to others  
To possibly use it as a portfolio in the future  

For me, interest, understanding, and growth are more important than perfect code

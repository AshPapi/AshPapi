# 👋 Hi, I'm AshPapi

I am a versatile developer who loves trying new things and learning from every project.  
Here I keep my experiments, learning projects, and small achievements, a place to track my growth.  

Sometimes a Minecraft mod in Java, sometimes a Python clicker, sometimes an experiment with C++ neural networks — every project teaches me something new.

## 🛠️ Skills & Projects

**C++:** algorithms, data structures, simple neural networks, software engineering with UML  
**Python:** learning exercises, clicker game, Django web project  
**Java:** game projects, Minecraft mods  
**Web:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, mini-sites  
**Systems & DBs:** Linux (Arch), Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle SQL  

## 🎯 Purpose

Track personal growth, share useful projects, and possibly showcase my work in the future.  
Interest and learning are more important to me than perfect code.
